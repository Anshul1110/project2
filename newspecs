similar to referral system
user registers via fb/google, and adds people under him (links/referrals)

there are levels in nodes
level 1 - 5 nodes, 25000 credits, Max 7 links to level 2(referrals)
level 2 - 10 nodes, 10000 credits, Max 35 links to level 3 (referrals)
level 3 - 50 nodes, 5000 credits, Max 70 links to level 4(referrals)
level 4 - 100 nodes, 1000 credits, etc..

after register, user is given
level 1

after 5 registrations, error saying level 1 is full, adding to level 2, after level 2 full, level 3, etc
